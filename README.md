# CSMODEL Machine Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a real-world dataset to answer a research question through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical inference. 

The project is divided into two phases: Phase 1 focuses on the dataset description, data cleaning, research question formulation, and EDA. Phase 2 focuses on the data mining techniques, preprocessing techniques, statistical inference, and conclusions.

## Group Members

- CABATO, Marxandrea Diane G.
- QUIJANO, Jan Philip Alexandre
- MARCELO, Chrystel Anne L.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Family Income and Expenditure Survey 2012 Vol 1
- **Source**: Philippine Statistics Authority
- **Description**: The dataset contains anonymized microdata on household income from various sources (such as salaries, businesses, and remittances), categorized expenditures (including food, housing, education, health, and utilities), as well as demographic and geographic variables like region and urban/rural classification. Household characteristics such as household size and number of earners are also included.

## Research Question

How can household spending behaviors be grouped based on expenditure allocation patterns, and how do these behavioral clusters relate to income levels?

## Phase 1 Deliverables

1. **Dataset Description**:

   - How the dataset was collected.
   - Potential implications of the data collection method on insights.
   - Structure of the data (rows, columns, attributes).

2. **Data Cleaning**:

   - Steps taken to address missing data, duplicates, outliers, etc.
   - Explanation of preprocessing techniques applied.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - At least three EDA questions with corresponding numerical summaries and visualizations.

## Phase 2 Deliverables

1. **Data Mining**:

   - Applying data mining techniques.
   - Preprocessing techniques to transform the data into appropriate representations.

2. **Statistical Inference**:

   - At least three statistical tests must be performed to confirm or disprove the conclusions generated.
   - Interpretation of the results in the context of the research question.

3. **Insights and Conclusions**:

   - Must include a summary of the key findings and insights that were generated from the project.
   - Provide a cohesive data narrative.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn, etc.

## Submission

- **Deadline**: July 28, 2025 (Monday), 8:00 AM
- **Format**: Jupyter Notebook with Markdown explanations and executable code.
