# CSMODEL Machine Project - Phase 1

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a real-world dataset to answer a research question through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical inference. The project is divided into two phases, with Phase 1 focusing on dataset description, data cleaning, research question formulation, and EDA.

## Group Members

- CABATO, Marxandrea Diane G.
- QUIJANO, Jan Philip Alexandre
- MARCELO, Chrystel Anne L.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Family Income and Expenditure Survey 2012 Vol 1
- **Source**: Philippine Statistics Authority
- **Description**: The dataset contains anonymized microdata on household income from various sources (such as salaries, businesses, and remittances), categorized expenditures (including food, housing, education, health, and utilities), as well as demographic and geographic variables like region and urban/rural classification. Household characteristics such as household size and number of earners are also included.

## Research Question

What are the key differences in expenditure allocation (e.g., food, education, utilities) across income groups?

## Phase 1 Deliverables

1. **Dataset Description**:

   - How the dataset was collected.
   - Potential implications of the data collection method on insights.
   - Structure of the data (rows, columns, attributes).

2. **Data Cleaning**:

   - Steps taken to address missing data, duplicates, outliers, etc.
   - Explanation of preprocessing techniques applied.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - At least three EDA questions with corresponding numerical summaries and visualizations.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

## Submission

- **Deadline**: June 23, 2025 (Monday), 8:00 AM
- **Format**: Jupyter Notebook with Markdown explanations and executable code.
