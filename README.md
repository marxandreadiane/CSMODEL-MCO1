# CSMODEL Machine Project - Phase 1

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a real-world dataset to answer a research question through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical inference. The project is divided into two phases, with Phase 1 focusing on dataset description, data cleaning, research question formulation, and EDA.

## Group Members

- AGUARIN, Trish Ann Danielle C.
- CABATO, Marxandrea Diane G.
- QUIJANO, Jan Philip Alexandre
- MARCELO, Chrystel Anne

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Family Income and Expenditure Survey 2012 Vol 1
- **Source**: Philippine Statistics Authority
- **Description**: [Brief description of the dataset, including its structure, number of observations, and attributes]

## Research Question

What are the key differences in expenditure allocation (e.g., food, education, utilities) across income groups?

## Phase 1 Deliverables

1. **Dataset Description**:

   - How the dataset was collected.
   - Potential implications of the data collection method on insights.
   - Structure of the data (rows, columns, attributes).

2. **Data Cleaning**:

   - Steps taken to address missing data, duplicates, outliers, etc.
   - Explanation of preprocessing techniques applied.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - At least three EDA questions with corresponding numerical summaries and visualizations.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

## Submission

- **Deadline**: June 20, 2025 (Friday), 11:59 PM
- **Format**: Jupyter Notebook with Markdown explanations and executable code.

## Academic Honesty and AI Use

- All code and text must be original or properly attributed.
- Generative AI tools may be used for code assistance only, with disclosure as per the project guidelines.

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

- Statistical inference and data mining techniques.
- Finalizing insights and conclusions.
- Poster submission.
